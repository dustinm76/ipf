* Name
  ipf - gitIgnored Paths Filter

* Synopsis
  ipf [options] [paths]

* Description
  Outputs paths that are trackable by the current git repository. Reads from
  stdin if no paths are given.

* Options
** --null-input
   Input paths are terminated by a null character instead of by whitespace, and
   the quotes and backslash are not special (every character is taken
   literally). Disables the end of file string, which is treated like any other
   argument. Useful when paths might contain white space, quote marks, or
   backslashes. The GNU find -print0 option produces input suitable for this
   mode.

** --null-output
   Output paths are terminated by a null character instead of by whitespace.

* Examples
  *find . | ipf*

  This will print every trackable file in the directory.
